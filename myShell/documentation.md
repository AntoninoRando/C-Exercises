# Wrong Input
There are 2 types of wrong input:
- fixable: the shell ignores the bad input and compiles it;
- fatals: the shell doesn't execute the input and notify the user about the error.
For example:
- `shell command1;; command2` is a wrong typed input because of the two semicolons, but this error can easely be fixed removing one of them;
- `shell command1command2` can't be fixed as this is considere one single and non-exiting command.
